# User Research & Prototyp Assignment

**This Prototyp is made as a group assignment in a UX/Usability course.**

**The task was to choose a societal issue and select a "pretend" client to assist in developing a solution that could help make the world a little better.**

**In this assignment, we chose to "assist" WWF in developing a solution to spread awareness about biodiversity.**

**We began by conducting user research to determine which target audience to address and also what people want more of.**

**Following that, we created a prototype to provide users with more knowledge and also tips on what changes they can make in their daily lives to contribute to better biodiversity.**
